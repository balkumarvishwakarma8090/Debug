How to collect ETL logs:
1. Create logs.reg file which contains all register entries from the bottom of this site. Ready to use file is available here
Copy file to tested machine if needed.
2. Right click on this file and choose "merge". This action should be done only once.
From next boot OS should start collect ETL logs
3. Reboot OS
4. After each boot ETL log should be create in C:\Windows\Tracing folder. In this step, size of this folder should be 0 because logs are saved after each reboot.
Each OS reboot cause that ETL logs from RAM are collected and saved to previously created ETL log with 0 kb size.
ETL logs contain information from start to shutdown OS
5. In practice testing with collecting ETL logs should looks like that
• OS is starting. New ETL log file is created with 0 kb size.
• Testing
• OS Reboot
Save ETL file with nonzero size
after more then one restart ETL log file is more then 0kb
